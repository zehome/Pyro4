PYRO - Python Remote Objects
============================

Pyro enables you to build applications in which objects can talk
to each other over the network, with minimal programming effort.
You can just use normal Python method calls to call objects on
other machines. Pyro is a pure Python library so it
runs on many different platforms and Python versions.
